This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to categorize data based on selected features. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, apply an SVM model with different kernels, and evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

 Features:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, removing columns, etc.)

Implementation of SVM with kernel (default RBF)

Model training and prediction

Performance evaluation using accuracy score
